#--- Lesson 21: Inner joins


Can you use an inner join to pair each character name with the actor who plays them? Select the columns: character.name, character_actor.actor_name

SELECT character.name, character_actor.actor_name
FROM character
INNER JOIN character_actor
ON character.id = character_actor.character_id;

Result:
name		    actor_name
Doogie Howser	Neil Patrick Harris
Barney Stinson	Neil Patrick Harris
Lily Aldrin	Alyson Hannigan
Willow Rosenberg	Alyson Hannigan

Can you use two joins to pair each character name with the actor who plays them? Select the columns: character.name, actor.name


SELECT character.name, actor.name
FROM character
INNER JOIN character_actor
ON character.id = character_actor.character_id
INNER JOIN actor
ON character_actor.actor_id= actor.id;


Result:

Can you use left joins to match character names with the actors that play them? Select the columns: character.name, actor.name

SELECT character.name, actor.name 
FROM character
LEFT JOIN character_actor
ON character.id = character_actor.character_id
LEFT JOIN actor 
ON character_actor.actor_id = actor.id;		

Result:
name			name

Steve Urkel		null
Homer Simpson		null


#--- Lesson 25: Table alias

Can you use left joins to match character names with the actors that play them, and use aliases to make the query shorter? The aliases for character, character_actor, and actor should be c, ca, and a.

SELECT c.name, a.name
FROM character AS c
LEFT JOIN character_actor AS ca
ON c.id = ca.character_id
LEFT JOIN actor AS a
ON ca.actor_id = a.id;

Result:
name			name
Doogie Howser	Neil Patrick Harris
Barney Stinson	Neil Patrick Harris
Lily Aldrin	Alyson Hannigan
Willow Rosenberg Alyson Hannigan
Steve Urkel		null
Homer Simpson		null


#--- Lesson 26: Column alias


Can you use left joins to match character names with the actors that play them, and use aliases to call the two columns returned character and actor?


SELECT character.name AS character, actor.name AS actor
FROM character
LEFT JOIN character_actor
ON character.id = character_actor.character_id
LEFT JOIN actor
ON character_actor.actor_id = actor.id
