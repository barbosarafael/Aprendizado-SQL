#--- Lesson 27: Self joins

Current tables:
rps
id	name	defeats_id
1	Rock	3
2	Paper	1
3	Scissors	2
employees
id	name		title			boss_id
1	Patrick Smith	Software Engineer	2
2	Abigail Reed	Engineering Manager	3
3	Bob Carey	Director of Engineering	4
4	Maxine Tang	CEO			null

Can you run a query that returns the name of an employee and the name of their boss? Use column aliases to make the columns employee_name and boss_name.


SELECT emp1.name AS employee_name, emp2.name AS boss_name
FROM employees AS emp1
INNER JOIN employees AS emp2
ON emp1.boss_id = emp2.id


Result:
employee_name	boss_name
Patrick Smith	Abigail Reed
Abigail Reed	Bob Carey
Bob Carey	Maxine Tang


#--- Lesson 28: LIKE


robots
id	name
1	Robot 2000
2	Champion Robot 2001
3	Dragon
4	Turbo Robot 2002
5	Super Robot 2003
6	Super Turbo Robot 2004
7	Not A Robot
8	Unreleased Turbo Robot 2111


Can you run a query that returns "Robot" followed by a year between 2000 and 2099? (So 2015 is a valid value at the end, but 2123 is not.)


SELECT * FROM robots
WHERE name LIKE "%Robot 20__"


#--- Lesson 29: CASE

friends_of_pickles
id	name	gender	species	height_cm
1	Dave	male	human	180
2	Mary	female	human	160
3	Fry	male	cat	30
4	Leela	female	cat	25
5	Odie	male	dog	40
6	Jumpy	male	dog	35
7	Sneakers male	dog	55

Can you return the results with a column named sound that returns "talk" for humans, "bark" for dogs, and "meow" for cats?


SELECT *,
CASE WHEN species = "human" THEN "talk"
WHEN species = "dog" THEN "bark"
ELSE "meow" 
END AS sound
FROM friends_of_pickles


#--- Lesson 30: SUBSTR


robots
id		name			location
1	R2000 - Robot 2000			New City, NY
2	R2001 - Champion Robot 2001	Palo Alto, CA
3	D0001 - Dragon			New York City, NY
4	R2002 - Turbo Robot 2002	Spring Valley, NY
5	R2003 - Super Robot 2003	Nyack, NY
6	R2004 - Super Turbo Robot 2004	Tampa, FL
7	N0001 - Not A Robot		Seattle, WA
8	U2111 - Unreleased Turbo Robot 2111	Buffalo, NY

Can you return all of the robots that are located in NY?


SELECT * FROM robots 
WHERE SUBSTR(location, -2) 
LIKE '%NY'


#--- Lesson 31: COALESCE

fighters
id	name	gun	sword	tank
1	US Marine	Colt 9mm SMG	Swiss Army Knife	M1A1 Abrams Tank
2	John Wilkes Booth	.44 caliber Derringer	null	null
3	Zorro	null	Sword of Zorro	null
4	Innocent Bystander	null	null	null


Suppose that a fighter's tank could count as a weapon, and it would take precedence over the gun and the sword. Could you find each fighter's weapon in that scenario?


SELECT name, COALESCE(tank, gun, sword) as weapon 
FROM fighters;
